/**
 * @title Oval contract to provide permissioned updating at the execution of an MEV-share auction.
 * @dev This contract works by conditionally returning a stale value oracle price from the source adapter until a
 * permissioned actor calls the unlockLatestValue function. The call to unlockLatestValue is submitted via an MEV-share
 * auction and will be backrun by the winner of the auction. The backrunner has access to the most recent newly unlocked
 * source price. If someone tries to front-run the call to unlockLatestValue, the caller will receive a stale value. If
 * the permissioned actor does not call unlockLatestValue within the lockWindow, the latest value that is at least
 * lockWindow seconds old will be returned. This contract is intended to be used in conjunction with a Controller
 * contract that governs who can call unlockLatestValue.
